C/C++ Candidate Assessment

Programming Assignments

Please read the following scenarios and submit a solution for each scenario based on the guidelines.  
Solutions will be evaluated for 
	solution correctness, 
	general coding style, 
	maintainability, 
	and level of documentation.  

Each solution should include:

* A Visual Studio Solution File (.sln) which references all of the necessary projects and can be used to build and execute the application.

* Enough code (usually a simple console application will do) to demonstrate using the solution to the scenario and that it produces correct output.

* If any additional components or libraries are required, those components should either be included with the solution or listed in a document with hyperlinks for download.

* Some level of code documentation, either through in-line comments or in a separate document, which details your approach to the solution.  
		
The documentation should be written based on the assumption that other developers would want to review or reuse your code.


Scenario 1
Write a struct definition to represent the qualities of a circle.  
Choose appropriate data types and values to represent diameter, radius, center coordinates, whether the circle is filled (background color) and what that color is, or transparent. 
You may use enumerated types if it helps with the definition of any of the fields.


Scenario 2
Write a basic Time class, using the value from the C Standard library time() function.  
It should provide appropriate constructors, a copy constructor, and get/set functions for hours, minutes, seconds as well as a reset function (defaults to the current time).  
Create a simple console application to demonstrate the class and provide basic instructions to a new user through some means.
